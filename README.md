# ab-testing
This project aims to determine whether a new landing page for an e-commerce website will yield a better conversion rate than the old one. In order to do this, we will conduct an A/B test using a dataset that assigns the new landing page to a randomly selected group of users (the "treatment" group) and the old landing page to another group of users (the "control" group). By comparing the conversion rates of the two groups, we can determine whether the new landing page is an improvement over the old one.
